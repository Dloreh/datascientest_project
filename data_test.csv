4,5,missing,France,A Trip to Disney makes you all warm and fuzzy and an actual kid again. It's not as big as the US one but makes a fun filled happy day out. We went on the rides possible and they were incredible. By the end of the day you are exhausted but nothing a good coffee won't solve to get you till the fireworks show starts. It's magical and so enchanting it takes you back to being a kid watching your favorite Disney movies in those few minutes. Be cautious though if you doing a day trip the last train is at 12pm so you literally run for your life in order to get pass the crowds and get into the train to avoid being left behind. This was the highlight of my eurotrip.Â
